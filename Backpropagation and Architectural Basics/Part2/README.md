# Architectural Basics

Modified the code given in [MNIST Base Code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uJZvJdi5VprOQHROtJIHy0mnY2afjNlx) to achieve 99.4% validation accuracy with less than 20k Parameters and in less than 20 Epochs.

Below important concepts were used/considered while designing the network:
- Convolution Block 
- Receptive Field
- Kernels
